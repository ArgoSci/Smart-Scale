An Open Source bathroom scale with wireless Bluetooth communications to Android Smart Phones and other devices.

I hacked a cheap bathroom scale (20â‚¬) and added to it Bluetooth communications so I can track my weight on my Android Smart Phone.

All were done quick and with cheap price on mind. Total cost in materials were only about $75.

Material:

- digital bathroom scale: $20
- ARM LPC2103 microcontroller board: $15.6
- Bluetooth serial module: $6.6
- 16x2 LCD: $15
- batteries and support: $5
- various, like wires, etc: $12.5
TOTAL: ~$75.

Here on this github account I am sharing the firmware for the ARM LPC2103 microcontroller and the software for Android Smart Phones.
